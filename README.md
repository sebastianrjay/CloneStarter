# Update 4/28/2016

This was my first ever full-stack project, built in February 2015. For some reason two people decided to star the repository. While everything works solidly, it's ugly and I don't want it showing up on my Github user profile page. In order to remove those star ratings and thus prevent this project from showing up on my profile page, I've deleted its git history and re-pushed the repository to Github.

# Description

Clonestarter is a full-stack crowdfunding website for (fictional) cloning projects, based on Kickstarter. It was written in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone.js, HTML and CSS. Check it out at [clonestarter.net](http://clonestarter.net)!

# Features

- Just like on Kickstarter, users may only comment on projects they've started, or to which they've pledged
- Dynamic project show page allows user to toggle between a project's description, a list of its backers, and its comments
- JSON API minimizes data transfer from server to client
- State-of-the-art Rails user authentication
- Features errors in all Backbone.js forms, via customized JSON server encoding
- Production-quality Heroku Postgres database
- RESTful architecture minimizes the quantity of data loaded when switching between screens
- Guest login
