# About

This was my first ever full-stack project, built in February 2015. Everything 
works, although it looks somewhat unprofessional.

# Description

Clonestarter is a full-stack crowdfunding website for (fictional) cloning 
projects, based on Kickstarter. It was written in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, 
jQuery, Backbone.js, jBuilder, HTML and CSS/SASS.

# Features

- Just like on Kickstarter, users may only comment on projects they've started, 
or to which they've pledged
- Dynamic project show page allows user to toggle between a project's 
description, a list of its backers, and its comments
- JSON API minimizes data transfer from server to client
- Custom-built and fully secure session-based Rails user authentication
- Features errors in all Backbone.js forms, via customized JSON server encoding
- Production-quality Heroku Postgres database
- RESTful architecture minimizes the quantity of data loaded when switching 
between screens
- Guest login
